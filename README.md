CONTACT: Augmented Acoustics

This is just the processing code for the contact project. If you wish to replicate the whole system the code must be combined with Ableton and Max4live and the relevant patches which im afraid i have not uploaded here. The reason for doing this is that the max/msp side of things is quite rough round the edges and requires lots of knowledge about the internal working and setup etc. If you are desperate to recreate the project it would be a good idea to try writing the max/msp side yourself so you understand every component of it, then you can also control your own audio parameters over OSC.

Feel free to use this code to look at how the graphics/interfaces were done but in the spirit of open source please keep a list of creditors in your code if you copy anything.
